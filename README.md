# Screen Recorder and Scheduler

## Overview

This is a personal project that aims to provide a cost-free solution for recording your screen activities. The primary objective is to create a user-friendly program that allows users to schedule screen recordings, making it convenient for scenarios like attending virtual classes or capturing any screen content at specific times. The program automates the recording process, allowing users to focus on their tasks without worrying about manually starting and stopping the recording.

## Features

- **Scheduled Recordings:** Plan and schedule screen recordings in advance. This feature is particularly useful for situations where you cannot be present to initiate the recording.

- **Manual and Automatic Mode:** The program offers both manual and automatic recording modes. In the automatic mode, the recording begins based on the schedule set by the user.

- **Flexible Duration:** Users can set the desired duration for each recording session. This ensures that the program stops recording after a predefined time, preventing unnecessary long recordings.

- **Convenient Organization:** Recorded videos are saved in a specified directory, making it easy to access and review the content later.

- **Effortless Playback:** Users have the flexibility to watch the recorded videos at their convenience. This is especially beneficial for catching up on missed content or reviewing recorded material.

## How It Works

1. **Schedule:** Users set up a recording schedule, specifying the date, time, and duration of the recording session.

2. **Recording:** The program automatically initiates the recording at the scheduled time. Alternatively, users can start the recording manually if needed.

3. **Automatic Stop:** If a recording duration is specified, the program stops the recording after the set time. In manual mode, users can halt the recording whenever they choose.

4. **Organize:** Recorded videos are saved in the designated directory, ensuring easy access and efficient organization.
